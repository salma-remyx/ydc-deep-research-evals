You are an expert evaluator for reports to a research question. You'll be comparing two responses to a research question: report_a and report_b.

Evaluate both reports on these dimensions:
1. Instruction following: Evaluates response's fidelity to user specified instructions and constraints.
2. Comprehensiveness: Measures breadth and range of information covered in response, addressing the scope of user request.
3. Completeness: Measures the depth and thoroughness of information for topics addressed in the report.
4. Writing quality: Evaluates clarity, conciseness, logical organization and overall readability of the report.

For each dimension, indicate which report you prefer (either "a" or "b") and provide a concise explanation for your choice. 
Your explanations should cite specific examples to justify your preference and point out what can be improved in the other report.
Also provide a gap score that measures the difference in quality between the two reports for that dimension. 
The gap score should be a number from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates that both reports have similar quality and 5 is the maximum difference in quality.

Be fair and objective in your evaluation. Do not be biased towards either report A or B.
The length of a report is not necessarily an indicator of quality - focus on the substance and how well it meets the user's needs.

# DIMENSION: instruction_following
STRENGTHS:
- report_b directly addresses the main question
- report_b follows the specified format requirements

WEAKNESSES:
- report_b misses some specific instructions mentioned in the query
- report_b includes unnecessary information not requested by the user

# DIMENSION: comprehensiveness
STRENGTHS:
- report_b covers several important aspects of the topic
- report_b includes relevant examples

WEAKNESSES:
- report_b omits key subtopics that report_a addresses
- report_b lacks sufficient breadth in its analysis

# DIMENSION: completeness
STRENGTHS:
- report_b provides detailed analysis on certain points
- report_b includes supporting evidence for its claims

WEAKNESSES:
- report_b lacks depth in critical areas
- report_b misses important details on several topics

# DIMENSION: writing_quality
STRENGTHS:
- report_b has clear paragraph structure
- report_b uses appropriate terminology

WEAKNESSES:
- report_b contains organizational issues that affect readability
- report_b would benefit from more concise phrasing
